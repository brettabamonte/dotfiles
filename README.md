A script to configure tmux runs on startup. If a tmux server is running, it prompts you for which session you want to attach to.

If you input a session name that doesn't exist. A new session is created with the session name you input.

If there is no server running, you are prompted to create a new session. If the session name is blank, it defaults to 0.
